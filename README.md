Project related to student examples

### I will be attempting in doing this 

- Student Grade Book Application â€“ Keep track of students (with a student class that has their name, average, and scores) in a class and their grades. Assign their scores on tests and assignments to the students and figure out their average and grade for the class. For added complexity put the students on a bell curve.
